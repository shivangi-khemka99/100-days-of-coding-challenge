"Excel Sheet Column Title Conversion"

Leetcode solution link: https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-title/solutions/5131139/excel-sheet-column-title-conversion/

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
To convert an integer into its corresponding Excel column title, we can map each digit to a character ('A' to 'Z') and continuously divide the number by 26 to get the remainder and quotient. This process essentially converts the number from base 10 to base 26.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Initialize an empty string to store the column title.
2. While the columnNumber is greater than 0:
    Calculate the remainder when dividing the columnNumber by 26.
    Map the remainder to the corresponding character ('A' to 'Z').
    Append the character to the beginning of the title string.
    Update the columnNumber by subtracting the remainder and dividing by 26.
3. Return the column title.

# Complexity
Time complexity: O(log(columnNumber)) - We continuously divide the columnNumber by 26 until it becomes zero.

Space complexity: O(1) - Only constant space is used for storing characters.

# Code
```
class Solution:
    def convertToTitle(self, columnNumber: int) -> str:
        title = ""
        while columnNumber:
            columnNumber -= 1
            title = chr(columnNumber % 26 + ord('A')) + title
            columnNumber //= 26
        return title
