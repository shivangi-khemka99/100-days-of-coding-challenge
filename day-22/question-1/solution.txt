"Efficient Addition of Two Numbers Represented by Linked Lists"

Leetcode solution link: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/solutions/4781942/efficient-addition-of-two-numbers-represented-by-linked-lists/

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem involves adding two numbers represented by linked lists. We iterate through both linked lists simultaneously, calculating the sum of corresponding nodes along with any carry from the previous sum. We create a new linked list to store the result.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
We create a dummy node to serve as the head of the result linked list. We initialize a pointer current to this dummy node. We also initialize a variable carry to handle any carry during addition.

We iterate through both linked lists simultaneously until both of them are exhausted and there is no carry left. At each step, we calculate the sum of the current nodes of the linked lists along with the carry, update the carry for the next iteration, and append a new node with the sum mod 10 to the result linked list. We then move to the next nodes in both linked lists.

Finally, we return the next node of the dummy node, which contains the head of the result linked list.

# Complexity
Time complexity: O(max(n, m)), where n and m are the lengths of the input linked lists l1 and l2, respectively. We iterate through both linked lists once.

Space complexity: O(max(n, m)), the space used by the result linked list.

# Code
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy
        carry = 0
        
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            val1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            val2 = l2.val if l2 else 0

            total_sum = val1 + val2 + carry
            carry = total_sum // 10
            current.next = ListNode(total_sum % 10)
            current = current.next

            if l1:
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2:
                l2 = l2.next
        
        return dummy.next
