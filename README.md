# Commitment to the 100 Days of Code Challenge

I am embarking on the 100 Days of Code Challenge, pledging to allocate time daily for problem-solving to advance my skills and overcome challenges. I formally announce my participation in the 100DaysOfCode Challenge, commencing today!

I will abide by two fundamental rules:
1. Code for a minimum of one hour every day for the next 100 days, solving at least 3 questions per day.
2. If I miss a day, I commit to making up for it in the following days.
