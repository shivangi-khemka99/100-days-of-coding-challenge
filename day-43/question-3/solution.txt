"Binary Tree Evaluation using recursion"

Leetcode solution link: https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-boolean-binary-tree/solutions/5166443/binary-tree-evaluation-using-recursion/

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem seems to involve evaluating a binary tree based on certain conditions at each node.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The provided code defines a class Solution with a method evaluateTree that takes the root of a binary tree as input and returns a boolean value. The method recursively evaluates the binary tree based on the following conditions:

If the current node has no left child, it returns the value of the current node.
If the value of the current node is 2, it returns the logical OR of the evaluations of its left and right subtrees.
If the value of the current node is 3, it returns the logical AND of the evaluations of its left and right subtrees.

# Complexity
Time complexity:
In the worst case, the algorithm traverses each node of the binary tree once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

Space complexity:
The space complexity depends on the depth of the recursive call stack, which is proportional to the height of the tree. In the worst case, for a skewed binary tree, the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

# Code
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def evaluateTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not root.left: return root.val
        if root.val == 2:
            return self.evaluateTree(root.left) or self.evaluateTree(root.right)
        if root.val == 3:
            return self.evaluateTree(root.left) and self.evaluateTree(root.right)
