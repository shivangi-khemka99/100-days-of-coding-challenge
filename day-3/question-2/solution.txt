"Efficient Longest Common Prefix Solution Using Character Comparison"

Leetcode solution link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/solutions/4682116/efficient-longest-common-prefix-solution-using-character-comparison/

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem requires finding the longest common prefix among a list of strings.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The approach taken is to iterate through the characters of the first string in the list (strs[0]) and compare them with the corresponding characters in the same position of the other strings. The goal is to find the common prefix. The loop stops when a character mismatch is found.

# Complexity
Time complexity: O(N*M)
N is the number of strings in the list (len(strs)).
M is the average length of the strings (len(strs[0])).

Space complexity: O(1)
The space used is independent of the input size, as there are no additional data structures being created, and the space used is constant.

# Code
```
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        common = ""
        # Iterate over the characters of the first string along with their indices
        for j, char in enumerate(strs[0]):
            # Check if all characters at the current index are the same across all strings
            if all(j < len(i) and i[j] == char for i in strs):
                common += char  # Append the character to the common prefix
            else:
                break  # Break the loop if characters are not the same
        return common
    #O(N * M)
    # N - len(strs) ; M - len(strs[0])
